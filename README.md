# Police-FIR-Management-System-
The need for good record-keeping and information-sharing practices has taken on added significance in today’s global environment. Not only do good records provide crucial internal information, law enforcement agencies now need to communicate agency-to-agency and across States in order to protect the Nation’s citizens. Police FIR Management System has been implemented as an accessible application, which provides timely and accurate information on Offenders. The software implementation is a typical automated crime records management system, allowing data storage and criminal record interchange between the police. Since manual crime records keeping by police has been a high cost of saving data, as it is mostly associated with paperwork, frequent case of missing files because records are not properly secured and lack of good storage media which makes retrieval of records quite stressful and has leads to data redundancy. Therefore, we have developed an application that will help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the police security measures in keeping criminal records, and to provide the crime investigator with timely and accurate information about a particular crime in a specified location. The application was developed to eliminate paper-based information exchanges and to facilitate the electronic provision of criminal record to crime investigator.
